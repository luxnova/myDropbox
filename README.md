# myDropbox
This is a client for dropbox that allows users to interact with a photos folder in their account. The application creates a directory inside your dropbox account then allows you to upload and view photos from that directory.

I originally intended to make this project compatible with ICS (4.0) and up, however in the end I defaulted to making this project only compatible with the latest version (5.0+) to keep integrity of the UI and since there wasn't any specifications on the version to use. In this project I showcase many Material Design guidleines along with the new support library animations to create a seamless and fluid experience. 

Within the 48 hours alotted to complete this project I added as much functionality as I could. In the end I did not get to the photo editing, sound record, or text notes with editor. However, what I did add is bullet proof, clean and documented. What took up the most of my time was trying to store metadata along with a photo in the dropbox. After scouring the Dropbox Api documentation, I defaulted to implementing my own version of storing the metadata of the photo, though the method I implemented is only good while the application is installed (saving to shared preferences). I found this project to be a good and enriching excercise to build experience with api that I am both familar with and not familiar with. I will use this project as reference for other developers who wish to see the Dropbox Api implemented in like fashion.
